    <section id="glossary">

        <dl>
            <dt><strong>@Autowired:</strong></dt>
            <dd>Think of it like a magic stamp in your code. When you see @Autowired, it means that Spring, a tool in Java, automatically connects the right parts of your application. It makes it easier to link different pieces of your code by automatically figuring out how they should work together and creating objects when needed.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Bean:</strong></dt>
            <dd>A "Bean" is simply a data object. It stores information used in your software, like a container for data. Beans are often used in the Java programming language to organize and use data in a clear way.</dd>
        
            <dt><strong>Context and Dependency Injection (CDI):</strong></dt>
            <dd>Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) is a way to efficiently manage dependencies and access context information in an application. CDI helps you manage objects, known as Beans, in a container and control dependencies between them. This promotes loose coupling between different parts of an application and encourages code reusability.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Data Access Object (DAO):</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Data Access Object (DAO) represents an interface to the database in your application. It acts as a mediator between your application logic and the database. DAO allows you to retrieve, store, or modify data in the database without dealing with complex internal database details. It promotes a clean and organized structure in your software by separating data access logic from other parts of your application. In other words, DAO is your formal connection to the database.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Dependency Injection (DI):</strong></dt>
            <dd>Dependency Injection (DI) is an important concept in software development. It enables a clean separation of software components and minimizes dependencies between them. In formal settings, DI is used to optimize software organization. It ensures that required resources are provided by external sources rather than being created by the component itself. This significantly improves the maintainability and extensibility of software projects.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Framework:</strong></dt>
            <dd>A framework is like a toolkit for programmers. It provides pre-built tools and structures to help you program faster and more efficiently without having to create everything from scratch.</dd>

            <dt><strong>JPA (Java Persistence API):</strong> </dt>
            <dd>
                JPA stands for Java Persistence API and is a Java standard for managing database access in Java applications. JPA allows developers to perform database operations in Java applications without having to write SQL queries directly.
                JPA provides an object-oriented way to access databases, allowing developers to work with Java objects that represent database data in their Java application. This allows for easier handling and a cleaner separation between the application logic and the database communication.
                In practice, developers use JPA to access databases, store, retrieve, and update data. It's as if JPA is the bridge between the world of object-oriented programming and relational databases. </dd>

            <dt><strong>MVC Architecture (Model-View-Controller):</strong></dt>
            <dd>The MVC architectural pattern is a kind of blueprint for organizing your code in a software application. It's like dividing tasks in a team project.
            <ul>
                <li>The Model is like the brain. It manages the data and the business logic of your application. Think of it as the database and the rules for processing data.</li>
                <li>The View is like the appearance of your application, what users see and interact with. It displays information from the Model but without logic. It's like a store's shop window.</li>
                <li>The Controller is the mediator between the Model and the View. It receives user requests, processes them, and updates the Model or the View accordingly. It's like the conductor of an orchestra, ensuring that all instruments play in harmony.</li>
                </ul>
            Together, the MVC pattern allows a clear separation of data, presentation, and interaction in your application, making it easier to develop and maintain. Think of it as a team game where everyone has their special role.</dd>

            <dt><strong>ORM Object Relational Mapping: </strong></dt>
            <dd>
                It enables seamless interaction between object-oriented programming and relational databases.
                ORM facilitates the translation of database tables into object-oriented classes and vice versa. This allows developers to perform database operations using object-oriented code without having to manually write SQL queries. </dd>

            <dt><strong>POJO (Plain Old Java Object): </strong></dt>
            <dd>
                A POJO, which stands for "Plain Old Java Object", is a simple Java object without any special framework dependencies or additional requirements. It is, so to speak, a "normal" Java object that can be used independently of any special frameworks or technologies.
                POJOs are often used in Java development to represent data or business logic. They are simple, understandable and easily reusable. A POJO typically follows the basic conventions and best practices of Java programming, without any special extensions or interfaces.
                In the world of software development, POJO represents the idea that simple, straightforward objects are often more effective and maintainable than complex and highly specialized objects. A POJO is like a basic building block in a Lego set - simple, versatile and easy to combine. </dd>

            <dt><strong>Project Object Model (POM):</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Project Object Model (POM) is a fundamental concept in software development, especially in the context of Apache Maven. It is an XML file that represents a comprehensive blueprint for your project. The POM contains important information such as libraries, dependencies, versions and build settings. Similar to a blueprint, the POM gives your build management tool instructions for creating and managing your software. It acts as a guide that shows your project the path to successful completion.</dd>

            <dt><strong>Proxy design pattern:</strong></dt>
            <dd>The proxy design pattern is a concept in software development that is formally applied. It is used to control and control access to another object without using it directly.
                The proxy is a kind of intermediary or representative that stands between the client code and the actual object. It can be used to perform various tasks such as caching data, lazy loading of resources, or controlling access to an object. </dd>

            <dt><strong>XML (Extensible Markup Language):</strong></dt>
            <dd>XML stands for Extensible Markup Language and is a markup language for representing hierarchical structured data in text form. XML is often used to store and exchange data in a machine-readable form.
                XML uses tags to structure data. Each XML document consists of elements arranged in a hierarchical tree.</dd>

        <h2>The Impact of Violent Video Games on Youth: A Closer Look</h2>
        <article class="article">
            <p>Video games have become a popular form of entertainment in our digital era. However, the impact of violent video games, particularly war games, on youth and society at large has been a topic of concern and debate. This blog post aims to shed light on this issue by discussing key findings from two research papers and sharing personal observations.</p>
            <h3>Key Findings from Research</h3>

            <h3>The Relation of Violent Video Games to Adolescent Aggression</h3>
            <p>A study titled “The Relation of Violent Video Games to Adolescent Aggression: An Examination of Moderated Mediation Effect” found a significant positive correlation between exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression. In simpler terms, the more violent video games adolescents play, the more aggressive they tend to become. The study also found that normative beliefs about aggression (i.e., the acceptance and expectation of aggressive behavior as normal) had a mediation effect on exposure to violent video games and adolescent aggression. This means that if adolescents believe that aggression is normal, playing violent video games can make them more aggressive. Interestingly, the family environment also played a role. For individuals with a good family environment, exposure to violent video games had only a direct effect on aggression. However, for those with a poor family environment, it had both direct and indirect effects mediated by normative beliefs about aggression.</p>

            <h3>The Effects of Violent Video Games on Reactive-Proactive Aggression and Cyberbullying</h3>
            <p>Another study titled “The effects of violent video games on reactive-proactive aggression and cyberbullying” found that both reactive and proactive aggression scores were significantly higher in video game players with gaming addiction (GA), and there was no difference between players of violent games and players of non-violent games.</p>
            <p> Additionally, it was found that the risk of being a cyberbullying perpetrator was higher in players of violent video games, and the risk of being a cyberbullying victim was high in players of violent and non-violent video games who have GA.</p>

            <h3>Personal Observations and Thoughts</h3>
            <p>While these studies provide valuable insights, it's crucial to emphasize the urgency of addressing the broader societal implications of the normalization of violence and war through video games. As a programmer deeply entrenched in the world of technology and a former player of Grand Theft Auto, I approach this issue with a unique perspective. Games like the Call of Duty franchise and Grand Theft Auto, celebrated for their violent content, are undeniably on the rise. These virtual realms often depict dystopian scenarios where violence and crime not only prevail but are also glorified.</p>

            <p>As a father, this prompts a pressing question: should we continue investing significant time and resources into gaming experiences that potentially contribute to antisocial behavior and hinder societal progress? The popularity of these games raises concerns about their impact on shaping the values and attitudes of the youth.</p>

            <p>Stronger regulations are needed, especially to prevent underage individuals from accessing these potentially harmful games. Games featuring violent content should have clear warnings and reasonable usage limits to shield vulnerable audiences from adverse effects.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, the implications of violent video games on youth aggression and societal norms cannot be underestimated. As a society, we must urgently engage in discussions about robust content regulation and redirect our focus toward creating games that not only entertain but also contribute positively to the development of our youth and the advancement of society as a whole. It's a call to action for the gaming industry, regulators, and society to work collaboratively in shaping a gaming landscape that fosters both entertainment and societal well-being.</p>
