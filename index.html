        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my projectfolio website. I'm Marco, a passionate backend developer on a journey through the world of coding and innovation. This site is a showcase of my work, a collection that has grown since I first embarked on my coding adventure. As I continue to study to become a full-stack developer, my sights are set on entering the marketplace in August/September 2024 as a junior developer. My heart belongs to backend development, where I craft the digital infrastructure that powers our digital world. I invite you to explore my projects, each a piece of my coding story, and discover the solutions I've built with enthusiasm and dedication. Let's embark on this journey together!</p>
